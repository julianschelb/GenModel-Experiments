I am raising $5000 for Dan. Here is how you can help. Big Pharma is not our friend. Dan had the moral courage to expose them. https://www.gofundme.com/manage/lets-help-dan-abshear-big-pharma-whistleblower \u201cThere is a pathologically intimate relationship between corporations and the U.S. government- their collusion is expressed in the revolving door. \u201c In the Spring of 2006, I became a pharmaceutical corporate whistle blower. In February of that year, I had recruited a law firm with experience in pharmaceutical whistle blower lawsuits in Boston, which is a top place to file and submit pharmaceutical whistle blower cases.\u00a0 They agreed to represent me after I submitted a ten page document to them I composed- explaining why the wrongdoing of my employer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, needed to be addressed.\u00a0 They represented me on complete contingency, which meant that they would not be paid if they did not succeed in the whistle blower lawsuit they were submitting for me. The law firm submitted the whistle blower lawsuit against Novartis in April of 2006.\u00a0 And it was filed under seal, which means that I and my legal council cannot discuss the case whatsoever.\u00a0 It\u2019s a trick played by the D.O.J., to eliminate the possibility of media contact. I made a trip to Boston in July of 2006 to be asked hundreds of questions by various relevant government entities, such as the department of health and human services.\u00a0 Also, in the center of a large table in a conference room, was a phone, with numerous attorney generals from various states- all there to hear my answers to the hundreds of questions I was asked one day, for 8 hours.\u00a0 I spoke with complete knowledge of the evidence, and with total honesty.

WOMEN ARE ALWAYS WITH THE SUCCESSFUL !\nTHEREFORE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE SEDUCTION\nOF MEN !\none has to know from birth on that in this world\nyou cannot rely on anybody ! As a former whistleblower this article supports my years of contention that to ascend in any human institution, even in government and politics, you have to leave your conscience at the door. One can never regret serving the truth and what is right.  Henry\u2019s article also supports the view of just how morally corrupt all of our institutions really are, how the ends always justify the means to those in power, and that those at the so-called \u201ctop\u201d reflect by their deeds the very worst in our human natures.  Just this one example shows the corruption in major drug corporations, our government agencies, our flake politicians sitting in our useless legislatures, the medical community, the legal profession, and in our courts. There is not one spot on the carcass of our body politic which is not covered with putrid puss and sores, a body which has never suffered a cleansing bath much less any real purgation, and all coming from a completely filthy mind in control. Since they\u2019re likely to deplatform this GoFundMe account, I wouldn\u2019t use it\u2026.sorry Mr. Makow.

I\u2019m not surprised that whistleblowers find themselves on a secret blacklist. Decades ago I became unemployable in my local area. I don\u2019t remember exactly what my \u201ccrime\u201d had been. I certainly wasn\u2019t a whistleblower. I wasn\u2019t even a member of a trade union. All I can assume after so long is that it had something to do with my strong sense of injustice, whether committed against myself or another. I had a number of promising job interviews, but every one ended with a statement to the effect that there were other applicants, so \u201cwe\u2019ll let you know\u201d, but they never did. Around that time the local paper ran a story about claims made by others that the employment offices operated a blacklist. They denied this, of course, but they did admit that they would sometimes \u201cnot recommend\u201d certain people for employment and to have a secret number for potential employers to ring to learn about job applicants. If that\u2019s not blacklisting, I don\u2019t know what is. In the end I had to move away and find casual work using a false name until I discovered that this particular blacklist didn\u2019t extend to my new home town, by which time I\u2019d successfully built a reputation as the reliable worker I always had been. If there are blacklists operating at the local level involving low-level employment, it seems obvious to me that there would be something much more sinister and all-pervading at the \u201chigher end\u201d of the jobs market.

Christopher Brauchli \"If wishes were horses,Beggars might ride.\" \u2014John Ray, English Proverbs They have a lot in common\u2014the offices they once held, and their treatment of people. There is only one thing they do not have in common and it's what he wanted more than almost anything in the world. Here is what they have in common. She will be out of office for at least a year, having been removed from office by a military coup. He was removed from office as a result of an election in which votes were stolen from him and given to President Joe Biden by poll workers and other corrupt officials. Those people, he and his advisers would tell you, were the equivalent of the Myanmar military removing Aung San Suu Kyi from office for one year. Unlike former President Donald Trump, Suu Kyi enjoyed a distinguished career before events of 2017 took place. When she returned to Myanmar from England in 1988, she was placed under house arrest and kept there for 15 years becoming a global symbol for democracy. In 1991 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Following her release from house arrest in 2010, she became an internationally recognized symbol of the coming of democracy to Myanmar. In 2012 she was awarded the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal. During a visit to Myanmar in 2012, President Barack Obama described her as \"an icon of democracy who has inspired so many people, not just in this country but all around the world.\" In 2015 such accolades clearly distinguished her from Trump upon whom no one would shower such accolades. In the 2015 election in Myanmar, the National League for Democracy, of which Suu Kyi was a member, gained a parliamentary majority and Suu Kyi became the state counsellor, the equivalent of prime minister. The Rohingya and other observers thought that with her ascendance into power they would be treated as rightful citizens. They were to be disappointed. Suu Kyi and Trump have more in common than their removal from office. They both, to the dismay of the world and their own citizens, treated the unwanted in similar fashion. In the case of Suu Kyi, it was approving the military's treatment of the Rohingya Muslims who have lived in Myanmar for generations. In the case of Trump it was the treatment of immigrants seeking to enter the United States and establish lives here. In the case of Trump, families seeking asylum in the United States without permission were forcibly rendered asunder. Undocumented asylum-seekers were imprisoned. Accompanying children under the age of 18 were given to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services where they were shipped to assorted venues for eventual resettlement. As of this writing the parents of 628 migrant children separated from their families due to Trump administration policies at the U.S.-Mexico border between 2017 and 2018 have still not been located. Things were even worse in Suu Kyi's Myanmar. In a government-sponsored military action in 2017, more than a thousand Rohingyans were killed or raped, or burned to death by the military. More than a million Rohingya were driven from their homes and now live in refugee camps in Bangladesh. U.N. investigators said the military operations had \"genocidal intent.\" Nonetheless, as those atrocities were taking place, Suu Kyi defended the actions of the military saying, \"the military's actions were an appropriate response to a Rohingya militia uprising,\" and describing the generals who were accused of genocide as \"quite sweet.\" Both Trump and Suu Kyi will always be remembered for their treatment of their fellow human beings during their time in power. There is, however, one significant difference between Suu Kyi and Trump, and it is a difference that will forever trouble Trump. Whenever people think of Suu Kyi, they will also remember that Suu Kyi is the recipient of something Trump wanted more than almost anything else in the world\u2014the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump made no secret of his desire for that. In a self-aggrandizing moment at a campaign rally in January of the last year of his presidency, he complained about the fact that Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, was the winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. As Trump explained in his typically succinct style: \"I'm going to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize. I'll tell you about that. I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of the country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country. I said: 'What, did I have something to do with it?' Yeah, but you know, that's the way it is... I saved a big war, I've saved a couple of them.\" Mr. Abiy was awarded the prize on October 11, 2019 and gave his acceptance speech in Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2019. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump both congratulated Mr. Abiy on receiving the award. As we were to learn after the 2020 presidential election, when Trump loses, he does not congratulate the winner. Mr. Abiy never heard from Trump. As noted at the outset, Trump and Suu Kyi will be remembered for some of the same reasons. But to his ever-lasting distress, Trump will never be remembered for having received the Nobel Peace Prize.

Her government spoke of national reconciliation while denying the military's atrocities and doing nothing to stop its war on ethnic minorities \u2014 an explicit refusal to \"take sides\" which ensured the armed forces would continue to dominate the country's politics. Aung San Suu Kyi on October 22, 2013. (Claude Truong-Ngoc / Wikimedia Commons) The new issue of Jacobin is out now. Subscribe today and get a yearlong print and digital subscription. On February 1, Burma\u2019s military put an end to the country\u2019s ten-year experiment with democracy with a coup that can best be described as a partial \u201cself-coup.\u201d Tatmadaw (as the armed forces are known locally) already held considerable power and virtually total autonomy from civilian oversight, according to a power arrangement designed by the junta that ruled the country between 1988 and 2011. The takeover is puzzling for its apparent irrationality: Why would the generals now take the risk of dismantling the system they have so painstakingly built, which has served them well so far, and does not seem to be immediately threatened? After all, the coup removed a civilian government, led by the Nobel laureate and former dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, that after its first five-year term had given ample proof that it did not pose any threat to the military\u2019s interests. Instead, it had proven to share a virtually identical worldview. It had been a decade since the establishment of a so-called discipline-flourishing democracy carefully managed by the generals. This arrangement was initially praised by investors and the very same Western countries that had hitherto isolated Burma for the human rights violations committed by a military that had ruled the country in different iterations for almost fifty years. But this Monday, the commander in chief of the Tatmadaw, senior general Min Aung Hlaing, took power a few hours before the first session in parliament since November\u2019s elections. That vote had given Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) a resounding victory. But the coup followed weeks of unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud, first from the losing Tatmadaw\u2019s proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), and then from the military itself. Aung San Suu Kyi was put immediately under arrest, along with some members of her government and a few dozen activists and critics of the military. She is now charged with illegally importing communications equipment. Min Aung Hlaing now leads a military government under a state of emergency. He has promised that he will rule for just one year and will devolve power after organizing fresh and clean elections, but few trust he will keep his word, and, given historic precedents, there are more than reasonable fears of a bloodbath when the military crushes the movements of popular resistance that are already emerging. The allegations of electoral fraud used to justify the coup are obviously a mere facade, all the more flimsy coming from the military that organized in 2008 a sham referendum to approve an undemocratic constitution and, two years later, a highly controlled election, boycotted by the NLD, in which the highly unpopular USDP obtained a dubious victory that marked the beginning of the transition. While some irregularities may have taken place in the last election, they would have done little to alter the final result in a country where Suu Kyi and her party remain wildly popular. There has been some speculation that the commander in chief, approaching his retirement later this year, wanted to protect himself and his assets. But, again, if there is something that Suu Kyi has made clear since she took power in 2016, it is that she won\u2019t go against the generals. With scant information available at the moment, any attempt to make sense of the coup can only be tentative \u2014 looking for a rational explanation may well prove pointless. The military has claimed the move is legal, and there is much discussion about whether the takeover has followed proper procedures or whether the controversy around the election amounted to a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d that could \u201cdisintegrate the Union or disintegrate national solidarity,\u201d according to the article in the constitution invoked by the putschists. But debates about the \u201clegality\u201d of the move are largely beside the point. The generals wrote the law and interpret it \u2014 and law in contemporary Burma is a very flexible excuse that mostly serves to give a veneer of legitimacy to the use of power. A look at the very particular system created by the old junta only makes things more puzzling. The constitution gives the military control over the three key security ministries \u2014 Defense, Home Affairs, and Border Affairs \u2014 reserves 25 percent of seats in parliament to soldiers handpicked by the commander in chief, and grants the Tatmadaw total power over its own affairs, as well as blanket immunity against any prosecution for the crimes routinely committed in the several wars against ethnic armed groups in the periphery of the country. Suu Kyi has repeatedly pledged to change the constitution to reduce the power of the military, but ever since she became an MP after a by-election held in 2012, she has accepted the rules of the game laid out by the generals, and changing the constitution is virtually impossible, as it requires the votes of more than 75 percent of the parliament and a referendum in which more than half of eligible voters have to approve the proposed amendments. In this way, the Tatmadaw has managed to protect its interests, which include vast business conglomerates, but also fulfill what it has always seen as its historic mission: to preserve the unity of a country besieged by armed conflicts ever since its independence from the British in 1948. In the first five years of the transition, when the ex-general Thein Sein was the president after the USDP victory in the sham 2010 election, Aung San Suu Kyi contributed to give legitimacy to that system, both domestically and internationally. When she and some members of her party became MPs in 2012, they did little to challenge the government. Her strategy at the time consisted mainly in gaining the trust of the military in the name of \u201cnational reconciliation\u201d and discouraging any kind of mass movement that could jeopardize her rapprochement with the generals. Meanwhile, as the Thein Sein administration was engaging in a peace process with several ethnic armed groups, an old war was reignited in mid-2011 between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) after a fragile cease-fire that had lasted for seventeen years. Tens of thousands were displaced from their homes in the rugged mountains of Kachin State, in the north of the country, where the Burmese army committed atrocities against the civilian population. But Suu Kyi refused to commit herself on the issue \u2014 alleging that the issue was \u201cup to the government.\u201d Then, in mid-2012, a succession of waves of sectarian violence shook the western state of Arakan, pitting the Rakhine, the mostly Buddhist ethnic group dominant there, and the Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim minority that had suffered persecution for decades on the false grounds that they are \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d from Bangladesh. There was ample evidence that high officials in government had stoked anti-Rohingya sentiment and that the security forces took sides with Rakhine mobs in the violence, but Suu Kyi again refused to \u201ctake sides\u201d and posed the problem as one of lack of \u201crule of law,\u201d while others in her party and the old pro-democracy camp were more vocal in publicly attacking the Rohingya. Around that time, there emerged a nationwide ultranationalist movement led by Buddhist monks that portrayed Burmese Muslims as the vanguard of an international jihad to Islamize the country, provoking new waves of anti-Muslim violence in several towns in central Burma. Suu Kyi was mostly muted, but when the election came in November 2015, her party decided not to field a single Muslim candidate, for fear of alienating its Buddhist base. Back then, it was easy to believe that Suu Kyi was bidding her time and, keeping her cards close to her chest, she was trying to avoid alienating the Tatmadaw in order to be able to gain power and then introduce a reformist agenda. But her first term in office after winning the elections in 2015 frustrated those expectations. Imbued by a strong sense of destiny, first because she is daughter of the \u201cfather of modern Burma\u201d \u2014 the national hero Aung San, assassinated months before independence \u2014 and then because of her popularity both at home and abroad, she patiently waited for more than a quarter of a century to rule her country. In power, she has proved to have little idea of what to do with it, her lack of a clear political vision oddly mixed with a seemingly boundless self-confidence and a penchant for authoritarianism and micromanagement. Barred from the presidency by a clause in the constitution that prevents those with close foreign relatives from reaching the highest position \u2014 her two sons are British citizens \u2014 she created the position of \u201cstate counselor\u201d and reserved for herself the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, effectively putting herself \u201cabove the president.\u201d The military grudgingly accepted an arrangement that arguably stretched the letter and the spirit of the constitution, and she was allowed at last to lead the government. Otherwise, she would adhere scrupulously to the constitution, without trying to find loopholes that could help her to implement new policies. Instead of focusing on issues that were under the purview of the ministries she controlled, like introducing reforms in the neglected education and health care systems, she made the main priority of her government to solve a problem over which she had no control: the wars between the Tatmadaw and the ethnic armed groups fighting for autonomy. She dismissed the team that had worked on the peace process during the previous administration, only to stand behind the very same National Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) designed by the Thein Sein government and endorsed by the Tatmadaw. In this case, as in many others, Suu Kyi showed a perplexing tendency to assume as much control as possible, only to basically follow the same approach as her predecessors. In these conditions, the peace process during her term was an abject failure, with only a few insignificant armed groups signing the NCA. In fact, the new cabinet was a mixture of Suu Kyi\u2019s loyalists, apolitical technocrats, and stalwarts of the old regime, apparently confirming that, if the transition meant anything, it was a merger of two elites \u2014 the higher echelons of the military and the historic pro-democracy leaders \u2014 again in the guise of \u201cnational reconciliation.\u201d The economic elites \u2014 the infamous \u201ccronies\u201d that had made their fortunes plundering the country\u2019s natural resources through their contacts with the junta \u2014 kept their place in the new order, too, with the state counselor limiting herself to admonishing them to \u201cwork for others in the future.\u201d She has also adhered to the neoliberal programs that the generals had tried unsuccessfully in the 1990s, when international sanctions, corruption, and cronyism crushed the economy, and only started to take off during the transition, without doing anything to tackle the huge inequalities prevalent in the country. In parliament, her party left untouched most oppressive laws passed during the military dictatorship, despite having the majority, and the government used them profusely to jail journalists and activists critical of both the government and the military. Then came a new crisis in Arakan, where a new militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) emerged in October 2016 attacking the headquarters of Border Guard Police in Northern Arakan, eliciting a brutal response by the Tatmadaw. One year later, ARSA attacked again, and the military unleashed its full fury against the Rohingya population in Northern Arakan, killing thousands of civilians, torching entire villages, gang-raping scores of women, and sending more than seven hundred thousand traumatized refugees, around three-quarters of the total Rohingya population, to Bangladesh, where they still languish in the biggest refugee camp in the world, with no prospects of returning home. Aung San Suu Kyi and the civilian administration were not in control of the military operations, but her government fully supported them, denying well-documented reports of atrocities and putting the state media at the service of a propaganda campaign defending the Tatmadaw and portraying the Rohingya as an existential threat, often with chillingly dehumanizing connotations. Burma was accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and Suu Kyi led the defense in 2019, arguing that the military operations were a legitimate response against terrorism and defending the role of the rotten system of justice in Burma in persecuting any possible excess committed during the onslaught. That marked the point when she definitely went from human rights icon to despised accomplice of a genocide in the eyes of many abroad, but it boosted her popularity at home, where the Rohingya have few friends, and her intervention was disingenuously portrayed by the official propaganda as an almost heroic defense of the Burmese nation as a whole, rather than the state. Given this story, the recent coup seems to make little sense, especially considering the unpopularity of the Tatmadaw and the role of Suu Kyi in legitimizing its \u201cdemocratic\u201d system. But tensions between the military and the civilian government have been brewing for some time and have rapidly deteriorated since the election, as a result of the former\u2019s complaints of fraud and the latter\u2019s refusal to take them seriously. Apart from the complaints of fraud by the military and the refusal of the civilian government to take them seriously, there is another issue that has strained relations between them: recent developments in the war in Arakan between the Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army (AA), a Rakhine ethnonationalist guerrilla armed group (not to be mistaken for the Rohingya militants of ARSA). Founded in 2009, two years ago the AA ramped up its attacks on the military in the state, where it counts on wide popular support among a population that sees the central government, dominated by the Bamar majority, as invaders. The war in Arakan has turned into the most violent conflict in the country, while the government excluded the AA from the peace talks and declared it a terrorist organization in March 2020. Some weeks before the elections, the AA kidnapped three NLD candidates, and shortly after the Union Election Commission decided to cancel the polls in most of the state alleging security reasons. But shortly after, conversations between the Tatmadaw and the AA resulted in an informal cease-fire. The AA issued a statement calling for elections in the whole of the state, where the NLD is likely to lose, and the military supported the proposal, but Suu Kyi\u2019s government refused to organize them, even after her three candidates were released on January 1. In a situation in which both the NLD and the Tatmadaw feel entitled to wield ultimate power, the perceived slights of an increasingly assertive Suu Kyi and her unwillingness to cooperate with them on Arakan seem to have been too much to swallow for the generals, and in a pique that has escalated in the last months, they may have decided that it was necessary \u201cto put her in her place\u201d and reassert their dominance. The coup has already elicited wide condemnation among leaders in the West, which is again threatening the same kind of sanctions that failed to make any dent in the Tatmadaw during the military dictatorship. There is an assumption that the generals, who had taken Western leaders for fools at the beginning of the transition, care about how they are perceived abroad \u2014 but that is just a myth that has proven false time and again. This is no less true with this putsch, which has also shown how little the men in uniform care about how they are perceived within their own country. Thus seems to have come to an end, for the moment at least, the inglorious political career of Aung San Suu Kyi \u2014 the woman destined to rule her country but who didn\u2019t know what to do with her power once she obtained it, and used it to defend the most atrocious crimes. The paradox of Suu Kyi is that she has governed with a strange mix of caution \u2014 not implementing any policy that could harm the interests of the Tatmadaw \u2014 and arrogance\u2014not consulting or listening to the soldiers with whom she was supposed to share power. If this first approach made her civilian government powerless to effect any meaningful change, the latter has ultimately led to her downfall. There is little reason to express sympathy for her. Our solidarity should go to the millions of ordinary Burmese who have suffered under military rule \u2014 and will probably continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

So many of its buildings, once gorgeous, were in an advanced state of decay. This city looked better before World War II, for sure, and certainly a century ago. Since escaping Communism, Budapest is regaining its glories, though not at the same pace as Prague. There\u2019s a peculiar local fad called ruin pubs, where hip types can drink and dance in these half wrecked buildings. Too creaky to boogie, I only glimpsed them from the outside, but they didn\u2019t look half bad. In the subway concourses, there were many homeless, and they stayed there all day. Other aimless types loitered. The underground shops offered food, drinks, magazines and flowers. Some were owned by Chinese. At street level, there were many gyro shops run by Greeks, Turks or just plain Hungarians. According to the 2011 census, 7.3% of Budapest residents were foreign-born, but most were just ethnic Hungarians arriving from Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. Before World War II, there were 200,000 Jews in Budapest and they had the largest synagogue in all of Europe. Half would be massacred by Germans and their Hungarian allies. In the countryside, a Jew\u2019s chance of survival was even worse. Many Gypsies were also killed. Estimates of Gypsies in Hungary range from 3.1 to more than 10%. Thanks to a high birthrate, that percentage is constantly increasing. Many of the most famous Hungarians were, well, not Hungarian, as in Magyar. Franz Liszt was German. Bela Bartok was half German and a quarter Serbian. Houdini, Robert Capa, Arthur Koestler and Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz were Jews. Hungary has gotten much bad press lately because of Viktor Orban. Newsweek compared him to Mussolini, and John McCain described him as \u201ca neo-fascist dictator getting in bed with Vladimir Putin.\u201d When Orban became Prime Minister in 1998, he integrated Hungary into NATO so was seen as snugly in the Western camp, but with his second stint as Hungary\u2019s leader, from 2010 to now, Orban has made some bold moves against both Brussels and Washington. What has been most highlighted and lambasted is Orban\u2019s stance on the current refugee/illegal immigrant crisis, but some of his other decisions are even more rebellious against the hegemony of the AngloZionists, to borrow a term from the Saker. Orban rejected the IMF\u2019s austerity measures, increased Hungary\u2019s oversight over its Central Bank, raised taxes for all banks and, in 2013, even kicked out the International Monetary Fund. Orban\u2019s moves against banksters have not been foregrounded by the international press because banksters and their allies don\u2019t want you to think too much about their rampant criminal activities. In defiance of the AngloZionists\u2019 effort to isolate Russia, Orban\u2019s government agreed in 2014 to have South Stream go through Hungary. This Russian gas pipeline would also have crossed Turkey\u2019s territorial waters, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Slovenia and Austria. Though it would have benefited all of Europe, South Stream was scuttled by our global elites through pressure on Bulgaria. In contrast to Hungary\u2019s decision, Poland has gone out of its way to avoid relying on Russian natural gas by arranging in 2006 to buy from distant Qatar. Thanks to a delay in the construction of a sea terminal, Poland still hasn\u2019t quaffed any Qatar liquefied natural gas, though it\u2019s already paying through its nose due to contractual obligations. Huffing the Russian stuff costs a lot less. Besides seeking closer ties with Russia, Orban has repeatedly stressed that sanctions against Russia hurts all European countries. What he\u2019s advocating, then, is a Europe that must look out for its own interests in defiance of the suicide diktats from the AngloZionists. In 2011, Orban banned GMO crops from Hungary and destroyed 1,000 acres of corn planted with Monsanto seeds. Also of note is Orban\u2019s reaching out to Hungarians in neighboring countries. His government has provided monetary aid and even citizenship to all ethnic Hungarians (with the stipulation that one must speak the language to be naturalized). Thanks to the vindictive Treaty of Trianon after World War I, Hungary lost 71% of its land and 66% of its people. Not even Germany was truncated so ruthlessly. Orban\u2019s government has revoked tax-exemption status from most Hungarian religious organizations, including all versions of Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and Baha\u2019i, all but three Jewish synagogues, as well as many Christian orders or denominations such as Opus Dei, Benedictines, Marists, Carmelites, Mormons, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventists, Episcopalians and Methodists. The only ones to receive state recognition and support are those deemed traditional to Hungarian society. Echoing Putin and other leaders, Orban has condemned NGOs as a fifth column. Though as a young man, Orban received a four-month scholarship from the Soros Foundation to study in Oxford, he is fingering the Budapest-born Soros as an unwelcome meddler in Hungary and the rest of Europe. Thanks for the chump change, George, but bugger off! What you have, then, is a nationalist leader, and in Europe, we haven\u2019t seen one in a long while who\u2019s so unapologetic without sounding shrill. In his speeches and interviews, Orban explains himself quite clearly and candidly. To Die Weltwoche, a Swiss newspaper, Orban said in November of 2015, \u201cThere are terms and concepts which for a long time could not be uttered, but which are once again beginning to form part of public discourse. For example, \u2018borders\u2019\u2014are they good or bad? We can once again say that they have their good sides. Or \u2018nation\u2019: this word can once again be used in a positive sense. \u201cChristianity\u201d: most European leaders \u2013 including myself \u2013 are advised not to use this word too frequently, because most Europeans no longer feel Christian. Now, however, this word is once again returning to political debates. Or \u2018pride,\u2019 as in \u2018the pride of a nation\u2019: once again it has become a legitimate expression. A positive consequence of the migration crisis is that once again we are attempting to talk openly about our continent\u2019s identity\u2014more freely than in the past two decades.\u201d The refugee/illegal immigration crisis has also exposed the impotence of the European Union, \u201cThis negative impression over the EU\u2019s helplessness already existed before the migration crisis. The citizens of Europe saw it during the financial crisis and the crisis over Greece. They criticized their politicians for not being able to find a way out of the financial crisis. The stagnation of our national economies is still evident [\u2026] European citizens are convinced that their leaders are not effective. The migration crisis has, however, created a new impression. This is not related to effectiveness, but to democracy.\u201d With citizens having no inputs, and most European leaders unable to make decisions in their nation\u2019s interests, one is left to wonder who are behind all this mayhem? Orban, \u201cIt is hard to shake off this thought. We were debating for months, but the outcome was always the same: \u2018Let the people in.\u2019 And on top of this, in the first few months, for some reason no one was able to say out loud that this is an issue of the utmost importance for Europe. For months it was first regarded as a humanitarian issue, and then as a technical problem as to where the refugees should be settled and how they should be distributed. No one raised the question of whether the essence of the matter is more about our existence, our cultural identity and our way of life. I do not know for certain what is actually happening, and I do not want to blame anyone; but the suspicion arises that none of this is happening by chance. I am not brave enough to publicly talk about this as a certainty; the suspicion inevitably emerges, however, that there is some kind of master plan behind this.\u201d The same elites who\u2019ve weakened, if not destroyed, countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe and elsewhere have done so to the United States itself, and it has all been executed by design, for it\u2019s easier to rule and rob prostrated and confused populations. The master plan is to reduce citizens of whatever nation to disposable cogs that must compete for the lowest wages and be chained to lifelong debts, as dished out by criminal banks. In the United States, farcical elections are held with sustained fanfare to give an increasingly angry populace an illusion of political participation. Whoever is propped up as \u201cPresident,\u201d the military banking complex, Anglo Zionists or American Empire, call them what you will, will continue their rampage worldwide while eviscerating their host nation. Is there an alternative? Orban sees the world as having changed radically since the 2008 financial crisis, and there\u2019s no recovery, in his view. Though guarded in his statements, he\u2019s prepping Hungary for life beyond the collapse of both Washington and the European Union. In the meantime, Orban is straddling East and West. In August of 2014, Hungary was caught sending about 80 T-72 tanks to the Ukraine. Dumped for just $8,500 a piece, it hardly seems worth it to antagonize Russia. The Pentagon has also announced it will send heavy weapons and tanks to Hungary. Perhaps Orban will use these new tanks to retake the TransCarpathian as Ukraine weakens even further. Joining NATO in 1999, Hungary participated in the embargo of Yugoslavia, and for the American wars on Afghanistan and Iraq, it sent 360 then 300 troops, respectively. After aiding the American Empire, Hungary is dodging the consequence by rejecting legitimate refugees. Orban was disingenuous, then, when he claimed, \u201cWe did not destroy the countries from which migrants are coming. We did not bomb anyone. We did not invite anyone here. And now those who dropped the bombs and sent out invitations want to settle them here. Is this fair?\u201d Orban has evolved from a US-groomed prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to a critic of Uncle Sam. He has matured. It\u2019s interesting that in all former Communist countries, citizens have rejected any globalist vision, as embraced by the left, to elect nationalist governments. American politicians also speak of defending the nation\u2019s interests, but it\u2019s only so much hot air from jerking puppets. With sane, intelligent voices drown out by incessant garbage, there\u2019s no composure or wisdom in the public discourse. Instead, we get slogans or loutish insults. We dwell in a mad mental universe. In his 2013 Presidential Address, Vladimir Putin stated: \u201cToday, many nations are revising their moral values and ethical norms, eroding ethnic traditions and differences between peoples and cultures. Society is now required not only to recognize everyone\u2019s right to the freedom of consciousness, political views and privacy, but also to accept without question the equality of good and evil, strange as it seems, concepts that are opposite in meaning. This destruction of traditional values from above not only leads to negative consequences for society, but is also essentially anti-democratic, since it is carried out on the basis of abstract, speculative ideas, contrary to the will of the majority, which does not accept the changes occurring or the proposed revision of values. We know that there are more and more people in the world who support our position on defending traditional values that have made up the spiritual and moral foundation of civilization in every nation for thousands of years: the values of traditional families, real human life, including religious life, not just material existence but also spirituality, the values of humanism and global diversity. Of course, this is a conservative position. But speaking in the words of Nikolai Berdyaev, the point of conservatism is not that it prevents movement forward and upward, but that it prevents movement backward and downward, into chaotic darkness and a return to a primitive state. In recent years, we have seen how attempts to push supposedly more progressive development models onto other nations actually resulted in regression, barbarity and extensive bloodshed. This happened in many Middle Eastern and North African countries. This dramatic situation unfolded in Syria.\u201d These \u201cprogressive development models\u201d are nothing but dignified cloaks to hide barbaric imperialism. The USSR worked the same way. Having never been subjugated and humiliated, Americans have only dished out, and not experienced, \u201cchaotic darkness and a return to a primitive state,\u201d but the elites that have destroyed so many lives worldwide are also working against us Americans, so a future of terror and degradation will be our lot unless we can muster up the collective will to challenge our criminal overlords. Sniping at each other, there\u2019s no dialogue here, much less unity. It doesn\u2019t look promising. Linh Dinh is the author of two books of stories, five of poems, and a novel, Love Like Hate.

Crucial supply-lines to the north have been cut leaving the Sunni extremists and anti-government militias stranded inside a vast, urban cauldron. It\u2019s only a matter of time before these\u00a0disparate renegades are either killed or forced to surrender. A victory in Aleppo will change the course of the war by restoring government control over the densely-populated western corridor. This is why the Obama administration is frantically searching for ways to either delay or derail the Russian-led juggernaut and avoid the impending collapse of US policy in Syria. Recent peace talks in Geneva were convened with one goal in mind, to prevent Syrian President Bashar al Assad and loyalist forces from retaking Aleppo. The negotiations failed, however, when Washington\u2019s mercurial allies, the so called \u201cmoderate\u201d rebels, refused to participate. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Syrian opposition withdrew \u201cunder pressure from Saudi Arabia and Turkey, two of the main backers of the rebels.\u201d\u00a0 The WSJ\u2019s admission was later confirmed by Secretary of State John Kerry who according to a report in the Middle East Eye \u201cblamed the Syrian opposition for leaving the talks and paving the way for a joint offensive by the Syrian government and Russia on Aleppo.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t blame me,\u201d Kerry said, \u201cBlame the opposition. It was the opposition that didn\u2019t want to negotiate and didn\u2019t want a ceasefire, and they walked away.\u201d None of this will surprise readers who followed the talks closely. The meetings were surrounded by\u00a0confusion from the very onset. The US delegation headed by Kerry was focused entirely on reaching an agreement that would involve a ceasefire and stop the government-led onslaught. The Saudis, Turks and opposition leaders, however, were on a different page altogether. They\u00a0seemed oblivious to the dire situation on the ground where their jihadist foot soldiers were taking heavier losses by the day.\u00a0 Kerry, the realist, was looking for a way to\u00a0stand-down\u00a0and save\u00a0US-backed militants from certain annihilation. But\u00a0the Saudis and Turks felt they had a strong-enough hand to make demands. The clash in viewpoints\u00a0was bound to produce disappointing results, which it did. The meetings were\u00a0cancelled before they even began. Nothing was settled. Here\u2019s more from the WSJ: \u201cAbout a half-dozen cities and towns targeted in the new regime offensives have one thing in common: All were held by a mix of Islamist and moderate rebel groups funded and armed by Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Complicating the picture is that some, but not all, of these groups collaborate with the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. That gives the regime and its allies fodder for their claim that they are fighting terrorism.\u201d (\u201cSaudi Arabia, Turkey Pushed Syrian Opposition to Leave Talks\u201c, Wall Street Journal) This should dispel any illusion that that the fighters that are trying to topple the government are merely disgruntled nationalists determined to remove an \u201cevil dictator\u201d. That is not the case at all. While there are a fair amount of indigenous insurgents, the bulk of fighters are Sunni extremists bent on removing Assad and creating an Islamic Caliphate. This is why Moscow refused to implement a ceasefire during the talks in Geneva. Russia adamantly opposes any remedy that allows internationally-recognized terrorists from escaping\u00a0their eternal reward. Kerry has deliberately misled the public on this matter. Just last week, he said,\u00a0\u201cRussia has indicated to me very directly they are prepared to do a ceasefire\u2026 The Iranians confirmed in London just a day and a half ago they will support a ceasefire now.\u201d This is false and Kerry knows it. Moscow has tried to be flexible about other so called \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition forces, but when it comes to ISIS,\u00a0 Jabhat Al-Nusra (Syrian Al-Qaeda group), Jaysh Al-Mujahiddeen, Harakat Nouriddeen Al-Zinki, and Harakat Ahrar Al-Sham, Russian leaders have repeatedly said that that they will not relent until the\u00a0jihadists are either killed or captured.\u00a0\u00a0 This is why Russia\u2019s airstrikes continued during Geneva, because most of the fighters in Aleppo are dyed-in-the-wool terrorists. It\u2019s worth noting that the Russian-led military offensive clearly\u00a0hews to UN resolution 2254 which states: \u2026\u00a0for Member States to prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed  specifically by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Al-Nusra Front (ANF), and all other individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities associated with Al Qaeda or ISIL, and other terrorist groups, [\u2026] and to eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Syria, and notes that the aforementioned ceasefire will not apply to offensive or defensive actions against these individuals, groups, undertakings and entities, as set forth in the 14 November 2015 ISSG Statement.\u201d (Thanks to Moon of Alabama) In other words,\u00a0Moscow is not going to comply with any ceasefire that spares homicidal\u00a0jihadists or undermines UN resolution 2254.\u00a0Russian military operations are going to continue until ISIS, al Nusra and the other\u00a0terrorist militias\u00a0are defeated. Even so, Kerry has not abandoned the diplomatic track. In fact, Kerry plans to meet Russian Foreign Minsiter Sergei Lavrov in Munich on February 11 for a meeting of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) to discuss \u201call the aspects of the Syrian settlement in line with the UN Security Council resolution 2254.\u201d The emergency meeting underscores the Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s utter desperation\u00a0in the face of the inexorable Russian-led military offensive. It\u2019s clear now that Obama and his lieutenants see the handwriting on the wall and realize that their sinister plan to use proxy\u00a0armies to remove Assad and splinter the country into three powerless regions is doomed to fail.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how the ISW summed it up on the Sic Semper Tyrannis website: \u201cBattlefield realities rather than great power politics will determine the ultimate terms of a settlement to end the Syrian Civil War. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies in Russia and Iran have internalized this basic principle even as Washington and other Western capitals pinned their hopes upon UN-sponsored Geneva Talks, which faltered only two days after they began on February 1, 2016. Russian airpower and Iranian manpower have brought President Assad within five miles of completing the encirclement of Aleppo City, the largest urban center in Syria and an opposition stronghold since 2012. \u2026The full encirclement of Aleppo City would fuel a humanitarian catastrophe, shatter opposition morale, fundamentally challenge Turkish strategic ambitions, and deny the opposition its most valuable bargaining chip before the international community.\u201d\u00a0 (\u201cISW recognizes reality in western Syria\u201c, Institute for the Study of War (ISW) Last week\u2019s fighting in northern Aleppo has transformed the battlespace and shifted the momentum in favor of the government, but it has not yet dampened support for the jihadists in places like Ankara or Riyadh. In fact, the Saudis have offered to deploy ground troops to Syria provided they are put under US command. As for Turkey, according to The Hill:\u00a0\u201cMoscow\u2019s Defense Ministry (has) accused Turkey of planning a military invasion of Syria.\u201d Here\u2019s more from\u00a0the same article: \u201cThe Russian Defence Ministry registers a growing number of signs of hidden preparation of the Turkish Armed Forces for active actions on the territory of Syria,\u201d ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement\u2026.Russia claimed\u00a0(to) have \u201creasonable grounds to suspect intensive preparation of Turkey for a military invasion\u201d of Syria.\u201d (The Hill) Turkish officials have denied that\u00a0they\u00a0are preparing for an invasion, but at the same time, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0has\u00a0admitted\u00a0that Turkey will not stay on the sidelines if it is asked to participate in a future campaign. This is from Bloomberg News: \u201cPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country should not repeat in Syria the same mistake it made in Iraq when it turned down a U.S. request to be part of the coalition that toppled Saddam Hussein. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fall into the same mistake in Syria as in Iraq,\u201d the president said, recounting how Turkey\u2019s parliament denied a U.S. request to use its territories for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \u201cIt\u2019s important to see the horizon. What\u2019s going on in Syria can only go on for so long. At some point it has to change,\u201d he told journalists on the return flight from a tour of Latin America, according to Hurriyet newspaper.\u201d (\u201cErdogan Signals Turkey Won\u2019t Stay Out of Syria If Asked to Join\u201c, Bloomberg) While it\u2019s impossible to know whether Turkey, Saudi Arabia or the US will actually invade Syria, it\u2019s clear by the panicky reaction to the encirclement of Aleppo, that all three countries feel their regional ambitions are more closely aligned with those of the jihadists than with the elected government in Damascus.\u00a0 This tacit alliance between the militants and their sponsors speaks volumes about the credibility of Washington\u2019s fake war on terror. Finally, in less than five months, loyalist forces aided by heavy Russian air cover, have shifted the balance of power in Syria,\u00a0forced thousands of\u00a0terrorist insurgents to\u00a0flee\u00a0their strongholds in the west, cleared the way for the return of millions of refugees and displaced civilians, and sabotaged\u00a0the malign plan to reshape the country so it better serves\u00a0Washington\u2019s\u00a0geopolitical interests.

Iran governor Valiollah Seif\u2019s central bank announced the decision in a television interview on January 29. The change will take effect on March 21, and it will impact all official financial and foreign exchange reports. \u201cIran\u2019s difficulties [in dealing] with the dollar,\u201d Seif said, \u201cwere in place from the time of the primary sanctions and this trend is continuing,\u201d but when it comes to other currencies, he added, \u201cwe face no limitations.\u201d In a piece published by Forbes, Dominic Dudley contends that this move is significant \u201cin the light of the recent\u00a0\u2018Muslim ban\u2018\u201d announced by Trump. Iran nationals were added to the order issued by the current U.S. administration, which prompted the Iranian government to vow to stop issuing visas to U.S. citizens. Dudley notes that since 1975, \u201cno Americans have been killed in terrorist attacks in the US by the citizens of the countries included in the ban,\u201d while countries such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 \u201chome of 15 of the 19 terrorists involved in the 9/11 attacks\u201d \u2014 were left out of the list of prohibited countries. Despite the country\u2019s decision to halt the use of the U.S. dollar as its base currency for exchange with other nations, Iran\u2019s top export is oil. In the global markets, oil is mainly purchased and sold in U.S. dollars. This fiscal year, Iran is expected to earn \u00a0$41 billion from oil sales, with countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and China\u00a0as their top clients. It\u2019s still uncertain how the country will manage to switch currencies without relying on the American currency. The shift, Dudley notes, \u201cwill add a degree of currency risk and volatility and is likely to complicate matters for the authorities.\u201d This matters because predominantly Muslim countries left out of the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d include Saudi Arabia, one of the world\u2019s top oil exporters. In the 1970s, the Arab nation struck a deal with U.S. President Richard Nixon establishing an alliance that would maintain the dollar as the standard oil exchange currency in exchange for military support from America. The use of the dollar as a standard currency for oil exchange was accepted by Saudi Arabia and the remaining block of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which include Iran and 11 other Middle Eastern, African, and South American countries. OPEC countries account for 42 percent of global oil production, holding 73 percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves. Due to its influence, the use of the U.S. dollar as its standard currency helps to keep demand for the U.S. dollar high, giving the currency the support it requires to remain \u201cthe world\u2019s reserve currency\u201d and preventing the effects of inflation from hitting the U.S. consumer. Iran\u2019s decision to exit this deal might impact the U.S. economy and threaten the dollar, prompting the U.S. government to take stern measures to combat Iran\u2019s actions. After all, Iran holds 13 percent of OPEC\u2019s oil reserves. This article (Iran Just Officially Ditched the Dollar in Major Blow to US: Here\u2019s Why It Matters) is free and open source.

The justices agreed in October to hear the case. On Friday, the court released its calendar for March, which has the case being argued on March 28. The case involves 17-year-old Gavin Grimm who was born female but identifies as male. He was allowed to use the boys\u2019 restroom at his high school in 2014. But after complaints, the school board adopted a policy requiring students to use either the restroom that corresponds with their biological gender or a private, single-stall restroom. A lower court had ordered the school board to accommodate Grimm. That order is on hold. Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Washington Times, LLC.

Whitehead, Rutherford Institute:  \u201cChildren are being targeted and sold for sex in America every day.\u201d\u2014John Ryan, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children There can only be one winner emerging from this year\u2019s Super Bowl LIV showdown between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs, but the biggest losers will be the hundreds of young girls and boys\u2014some as young as 9 years old\u2014who will be bought and sold for sex during the course of the big game. It\u2019s common to refer to this evil practice, which has become the\u00a0fastest growing business\u00a0in organized crime and the\u00a0second most-lucrative commodity traded\u00a0illegally after drugs and guns as child sex trafficking, but what we\u2019re really talking about is rape.  Adults purchase children for sex at least 2.5 million times a year\u00a0in the United States. It\u2019s not just young girls who are vulnerable to these predators, either. According to a\u00a0USA Today\u00a0investigative report, \u201cboys make up about 36% of children caught up in the U.S. sex industry\u00a0(about 60% are female and less than 5% are transgender males and females).\u201d Consider this:\u00a0every two minutes, a child is exploited in the sex industry. In Georgia alone, it is estimated that\u00a07,200 men (half of them in their 30s) seek to purchase sex with adolescent girls each month, averaging roughly 300 a day. On average, a child might be\u00a0raped by 6,000 men during a five-year period. It is estimated that\u00a0at least 100,000 children\u2014girls and boys\u2014are bought and sold for sex in the U.S. every year, with as many as 300,000 children in danger of being trafficked each year. Some of these children are forcefully abducted, others are runaways, and still others are sold into the system by relatives and acquaintances. Child rape has become Big Business in America. This is an industry that revolves around cheap sex on the fly, with young girls and women who are\u00a0sold to 50 men each day for $25 apiece, while their\u00a0handlers make $150,000 to $200,000 per child\u00a0each year. This is not a problem found only in big cities. It\u2019s happening everywhere, right under our noses, in suburbs, cities and towns across the nation. As Ernie Allen of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children points out, \u201cThe only way not to find this in any American city is simply not to look for it.\u201d Don\u2019t fool yourselves into believing that this is merely a concern for lower income communities or immigrants. It\u2019s not. It is estimated that there are\u00a0100,000 to 150,000 under-aged child sex workers in the U.S.\u00a0These girls aren\u2019t volunteering to be sex slaves. They\u2019re being lured\u2014forced\u2014trafficked into it. In most cases, they have no choice. Every transaction is rape. In order to avoid detection (in some cases\u00a0aided and abetted by the police) and cater to male buyers\u2019 demand for sex with different women, pimps and the gangs and crime syndicates they work for have turned sex trafficking into a highly mobile enterprise, with trafficked girls, boys and women constantly being moved from city to city, state to state, and country to country. For instance, the Baltimore-Washington area, referred to as\u00a0The Circuit, with its I-95 corridor dotted with rest stops, bus stations and truck stops, is a hub for the sex trade. No doubt about it: this is a highly profitable, highly organized and highly sophisticated sex trafficking business that operates in towns large and small,\u00a0raking in upwards of $9.5 billion a year in the U.S. alone\u00a0by abducting and selling young girls for sex. Every year, the girls being bought and sold gets younger and younger. The average age of those being trafficked is 13. Yet as the head of a group that combats trafficking pointed out, \u201cLet\u2019s think about what average means. That means there are children younger than 13.\u00a0That means 8-, 9-, 10-year-olds.\u201d \u201cFor every 10 women rescued, there are 50 to 100 more women who are brought in by the traffickers. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not 18- or 20-year-olds anymore,\u201d noted a 25-year-old victim of trafficking. \u201cThey\u2019re minors as young as 13 who are being trafficked.\u00a0They\u2019re little girls.\u201d This is America\u2019s dirty little secret. But what or who is driving this evil appetite for young flesh? Who buys a child for sex? Otherwise ordinary men\u00a0from all walks of life. \u201cThey could be your co-worker, doctor, pastor or spouse,\u201d writes journalist Tim Swarens, who spent more than a year investigating the sex trade in America. Catholic and Protestant churches have been particularly singled out in recent years for harboring these sexual predators. Twenty years after the clergy sex abuse scandal rocked the Catholic Church, hundreds of sexual predators\u2014priests, deacons, monks and lay people\u2014continue to be given work assignments in proximity to children. In many cases, the\u00a0abuse continues unabated. Although much less publicized, the sex crimes within the Protestant Church have been no less egregious. For instance, a recent expose into the Southern Baptist Church leaders by the\u00a0Houston Chronicle\u00a0documents over 700 child sex victims \u201cwho were\u00a0molested, sent explicit photos or texts, exposed to pornography, photographed nude, or repeatedly raped by youth pastors. Some victims as young as 3 were molested or raped inside pastors\u2019 studies and Sunday school classrooms.\u201d And then you have national sporting events such as the Super Bowl, where sex traffickers have been caught selling minors,\u00a0some as young as 9 years old. Yet even if the Super Bowl is not exactly a \u201cwindfall\u201d for sex traffickers as some claim, it remains a lucrative source of income for the child sex trafficking industry and a draw for those who are willing to pay to rape young children. According to criminal investigator Marc Chadderdon, these \u201cbuyers\u201d\u2014the so-called \u201cordinary\u201d men who drive the demand for sex with children\u2014represent a cross-section of American society:\u00a0every age, every race, every socio-economic background, cops, teachers, corrections workers, pastors, etc. And then there are the\u00a0extra-ordinary\u00a0men, such as Jeffrey Epstein, the hedge fund billionaire / convicted serial pedophile\u00a0who was arrested on charges of molesting, raping and sex trafficking dozens of young girls, only to die under highly unusual circumstances. It is believed that Epstein operated his own personal sex trafficking ring not only for his personal pleasure but also\u00a0for the pleasure of his friends and business associates. According to\u00a0The Washington Post, \u201cseveral of the young women\u2026say they were\u00a0offered to the rich and famous as sex partners\u00a0at Epstein\u2019s parties.\u201d At various times, Epstein ferried his friends about on his private plane,\u00a0nicknamed the \u201cLolita Express.\u201d Men like Epstein and his cronies, who belong to a\u00a0powerful, wealthy, elite segment of society\u00a0that operates according to their own rules, skate free of accountability by taking advantage of a\u00a0criminal justice system that panders to the powerful, the wealthy and the elite. Still, where did this appetite for young girls come from? Look around you. Young girls have been sexualized for years now in music videos, on billboards, in television ads, and in clothing stores. Marketers have created a demand for young flesh and a ready supply of over-sexualized children. \u201cIn a market that sells high heels for babies and thongs for tweens, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that\u00a0sex, if not porn, has invaded our lives,\u201d\u00a0writes Jessica Bennett for\u00a0Newsweek.\u00a0\u201cWhether we welcome it or not, television brings it into our living rooms and the Web brings it into our bedrooms. According to a 2007 study from the University of Alberta, as many as 90 percent of boys and 70 percent of girls aged 13 to 14 have accessed sexually explicit content at least once.\u201d Read More @ Rutherford.org", "entities": ["Super Bowl XLIV", "San Francisco", "Illegal drug trade", "Sex trafficking in the United States", "USA Today", "United States", "Georgia (U.S. state)", "Orders of magnitude (mass)", "Pareidolia", "Orders of magnitude (numbers)", "Rape", "50 (number)", "Human trafficking in the United States", "Ernie Allen", "National Center for Missing and Exploited Children", "100,000", "Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area", "Child", "Thirteenth grade", "Minor (law)", "Journalist", "The Real McCoys", "Southern Baptist Convention", "Houston Chronicle", "Detective", "Mick Stallard", "Jacob Epstein", "Lolita (disambiguation)", "Millennium", "Ageism"], "partisanship": "FarRight", "year": "2020", "hero": "None", "victim": "children, boys, transgender males and females, adolescent girls, child sex workers, sex slaves", "villain": "adults who purchase children, sexual predators, clergy, Jeffrey Epstein"}, {"article_id": "1513859517", "publication_date": "2020-02-06 01:27:10", "headline": "Birmingham dad who opposed LGBT lessons faces jail", "url": "http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=202049", "language": "en", "ap_syndicated": "False", "themes": "", "media_id": "31382", "media_name": "thetruthseeker.co.uk", "media_url": "http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk#spider", "origin_country": "Foreign", "article_text": "by tts-admin | Feb 6, 2020 | 15 comments Concerned parents and their children held protests outside Parkfield Community School (Birmingham) for months. Click to enlarge A Birmingham dad who refused to submit to a school\u2019s controversial and insensitive sexual equality policy is facing jail over his non-compliance. Jabar Hussain, 51, refused to let his son attend school because of a protracted dispute at Parkfield Community School in Alum Rock (Birmingham) over compulsory lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) lessons. Hussain, like many other Muslim parents, refused to allow his child to attend the lessons on religious grounds. The school suspended the so-called equality lessons in March 2019 (officially called the No Outsiders programme) only to re-introduce them in June, a move which infuriated concerned parents. Concerned parents, most of whom are Muslim, have long argued that the programme is a cover for promoting homosexuality and transgenderism. The concerned parents have argued that young children should not be exposed to such contentious issues at a tender age. Mr Hussein faces a hefty fine (to the tune of \u00a32,500) and a potential three-month jail sentence for refusing to let his nine-year-old son attend school, where he would have been exposed to the controversial No Outsiders programme. Mr Hussain is reportedly seeking a judicial review on the grounds that the controversial programme is \u201cincompatible\u201d with his rights and Muslim faith. The judicial review has been proposed on \u201csafeguarding risk\u201d grounds in so far as it allegedly promotes distorted notions of gender identity. The legal case, in addition to broader issues related to the controversial No Outsiders programme, is widely seen as an example of deep communal divisions and religious tensions in Britain. In addition, the school\u2019s and Birmingham City Council\u2019s insistence on implementing the controversial programme against the wishes of concerned parents has given rise to fears that the British establishment is determined to impose its norms and values on ethnic and religious minorities. Protesting parents were further dismayed in March 2019, when the Office for Standards in Education, Children\u2019s Services and Skills (Ofsted \u2013 the government department responsible for inspecting schools) ruled that the No Outsiders programme is \u201cage-appropriate\u201d. Source A brave man, fighting for his beliefs. Where\u2019s the rest of British parents? Where is your Christian zeal in this issue? I suspect totally gone as this rubbish wouldn\u2019t be in our classrooms in the first place. We are doomed, pedo lessons coming soon, i bet!! Jabar Hussain is protesting against this brainwashing campaign. What about English Aboriginals, do they accept this barbarity? Do they believe in \u201csexual orientations\u201d? Soon after the LGBT bull dust even the pedophilia will be legalized . What happens to the\nfreedom to have a dissenting opinion ? and the freedom of free speech ? Should the freedom of the individual be  subservient to the LGBT mambo Jambo ?  Now only the LGBT bull  s\u2026.. is the only opinion permissible and this beg this question about the Judges with who are  aligned the members of \u201d Judicial reviews \u201d ? Should this group be dismantled because no longer serves the needs of the wider community ? Why did the people ever allow or agree to the State taking charge of their children\u2019s education?    Why do people agree to it now?    Why are the Christians and others allowing this incredible abuse of their own children? If this muslim gent and his family can, they should return to their country of origin or a coyntey that does nor mandate this madness as education\u201d. It is better to suffer poverty than to be brought to ones knees obeying the commands of this Satanic ruling cult that insist on corrupting their precious children. As Malcom X said \u201cOnly a fool would let his enemy educate his children\u201d It is not christians or muslims This is all satanic and why we allow \u2026 It is a file and repulsive programme which should be stamped out at its roots,any respectable parent would and should take the same attitude as this man and if necessary mass demonstrations to support their actions against this practice. million Getaneh:  You are correct. People in the West have been given a constant dose of secularism. The same way that you can poison someone, by administrating a slow dose of poison without the persons knowledge, will ultimately lead to dead. That \u201cpoison\u201d of secularism was administrated in the educational system, entertainment, media and publishing and ultimately into the political realm. Even organized Religion has fallen victim to this diabolical scheme, by providing only \u201clip service\u201d, but there hearts are far from it. If a Nation turns its against the Creator, He will turn against that Nation. Divide and conquer lol where is the people power? Thing is it is still here but we are blinded the pit us against each other then they bend us over and lbgt us very hard. Get together over me dumb dumb dumb dumb. Let\u2019s first get our people as one white, black, Asian, Indian, arab, and all other cultures and creeds that\u2019s the only way we can win. Let\u2019s be as one and stop this his black his white his muslim his so and so and work as one unit. If we don\u2019t we have no hope what so ever. The photo above indicates that the only really decent people left in our nations who tend to have children and protect family values are non-whites and mostly Muslim. As a white person in Canada I can see even our separate schools overrun with the LGBT nonsense without a peep from the white parents with 1.2 children per family, and who really do not give a shit about anything but material prosperity and social status. When I look around for stable and straight families I only see a smattering of white Christian ones, in a sea of Sikh, Muslim, and Chinese ethnic communities which are thriving with family normalcy, children and prosperity \u2013 unless they are second and third generation types who have been brainwashed by the secular social engineering through our corrupt media and educational systems. Party politics is the tool to devide specially if the parties are all United under one banner. Henry h ..Where\u2019s the rest of British parents?\nThe answer is, they are part of the LGBTQRXYZ association \u2026. Believe it or not, our masters tested the water with the smoking ban. It was about control and public reaction. They were testing how the public would behave when you took away a basic right of them, by banning smoking in public places and of course, backed up your views with health scares. They found that overall, the public weren\u2019t that bothered, especially after being brainwashed with the \u2018passive smoking causes cancer\u2019 BS. And voila, 20+ years later and they\u2019re enforcing sodomy to be taught into schools and no one\u2019s really complaining. After all, they\u2019ve all got used to the sodomite brigade on the TV, from the Liberaches, to the John Inmans, the Larry Graysons to the Kenny Everets, the Freddie Mercurys to the Boy Georges and literally every second individual, on the TV and radio being a raging queen. So, obviously they accept the globohomo reality that now is. Just like Juden, the homosexuals, a tiny minority now have the upper hand, essentially now first class citizens, above everyone else who now are second class, the heterosexuals I believe they\u2019re called. Next step, arresting fathers who beat up paedophiles, who\u2019ve been trying to nonse their children. The psychologists are already promoting the \u201cthey were born that way\u201d just as they did with the homosexuals. I stated when I started blogging the simple truth \u2013 \u201cwhen you allow one taboo into society, you have no moral high ground into condemning the others\u201d. Pandora\u2019s box was opened and now we have the hell that\u2019s coming to face because of it.\nIt takes a Muslim, an immigrant to speak out against wrong in western society. This shows how pathetic it now is.\nHowever, that stated, the Muslims will get the last laugh. The homosexuals may currently be laughing but not in the future. Roll on 2030 and the Muslim population, completely anti indigenous and homosexual will be forcing their way of life on the rest. Roll on 2040 and it will have grown even more. Roll on 2050 and 2060 and they\u2019ll be winning lots of local elections, voting as a tribal block. And in will come an Islamic, Sharia party, instantly disbanding the House of Lords, the monarchy (good riddance I say) and ending all democracy every again (not that there ever was) and implementing the Muslim state, under the will of Allah. The homosexual men will be hanged. The homosexual women will be given a choice \u2013 pump out babies or join their male counterparts. Islamisation of the UK will certainly happen by 2060, very probably before. You won\u2019t see any sodomites laughing then, I can assure you of that.\nThis article shows one thing really and one thing only \u2013 the indigenous of the UK, don\u2019t deserve survival. Any country that allows sodomy, to be promoted in schools and to young children as natural, normal and moral behaviour, doesn\u2019t deserve to exist sadly. They hate and demonize islam because it is against everything they do or believe in. For example isis, al Qaeda, and daesh they are not muslim they kill muslims every day, they bomb mosques these are the enemies who pretend to be muslim but are in fact an army put there to demonize and kill muslims. We believe that every human being is born muslim first. Born innocent islam will be the last stand against these people they fear it. Christianity has been hijacked I mean they have made a film in the film jesus is gay why do the Christian\u2019s allow this? Wheres the love? indigenous, ie, white and / or Christian brits are charged with \u2018hate crime\u2019 laws whenever they object to novel indoctrination methods. The only reason this protest got as far as it did was because of the large concentration of muslims in the area.  In other regions, individual parents complaining have been reported to the local social services department for \u2018abusing\u2019 their children by teaching them to be hateful, and they have had to suffer the threat or reality of losing custody of their children to the state. In Germany home schooling has effectively been criminalised. Our courts do not approve of us anymore when it comes to \u2018hate crimes\u2019; we are all guilty until we can complete the impossible task of disproving a null hypothesis, with the harshest punishments considered just reward.  Hate laws do not care for the intent of the accused, only the \u2018feelings\u2019 of those crying \u201cI am offended by your hatefulness\u201d.   In some opinions, we have a two-tier justice system where the more traditional brits are automatically fascist, racist Nazis who are presumed highly likely to become violent or incite violence in others. This is (was) the globalist plan for the world \u2013 no more straight whites or Christians: everyone else gets a free pass.

He planted an American flag in 1846 into the city\u2019s soil to claim the land for the United States. A website that catalogs \u201cinteresting\u201d locations around the world wrote about the controversy: In the 1980s, San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery had the city commission a statue of Fallon raising the U.S. flag in San Jose at a cost of over $800,000. The statue was completed in 1988, and was scheduled to be located in the City Park Plaza (now known as Plaza de C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez) near the site of the flag raising. However local groups, including Hispanic Americans, protested that Fallon represented American imperialism and repression of the Mexican population. The statue was stored until 2002, when it was finally displayed in a small park northwest of the original proposed location, near Julian and St. James Streets.\u201d A now, even the more low-key location is being challenged, according to the San Francisco Chronicle report on public meetings held on the statue\u2019s fate: Community members used their 1-minute allotted time to persuade city officials to get rid of the controversial 16-foot-tall statue, many using the same words to describe Fallon\u2019s legacy: Colonialism. Imperialism. Racism. Injustice. White supremacy. Violence. Genocide. Fallon was one of the \u201csoldiers of John C. Fremont\u2019s brigade that was involved in the war with Mexico\u201d from 1846 to 1848, and he went on to serve one yearlong term as San Jose\u2019s 10th mayor, said Albert Camarillo, a Stanford University American history professor and historian. Some speakers suggested melting the bronze and commissioning local artists to repurpose the metal in a new statue more representative of San Jose\u2019s influential leaders of color. Some suggested moving the statue to a museum or local historical society where context could be given, and others proposed allowing Latino, indigenous and Black people to remove the statue. \u201cAs an immigrant, it makes me feel extremely unwanted and unwelcome,\u201d local high school student Valentina Coronel said in the Chronicle report, adding \u201cwe have basically destroyed the Native American, the Hispanic culture in the whole county. I see the remnants of the culture being erased quickly.\u201d \u201cEach time I see that, that\u2019s what I see: It\u2019s another example of colonization,\u201d Yolanda Guerra, a teacher at San Jose High School who lives in the neighborhood where the statue stands, said. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, who solicited evidence of Fallon\u2019s misdeeds, said it would cost about $400,000 to remove the statue and transport it elsewhere. Liccardo said in the Chronicle report: It\u2019s clear that many people strongly feel that Fallon has committed these horrible crimes. It would be helpful for us to have that record, and then we will have a very clear basis for saying \u2018let\u2019s move the statue.\u2019 In the meantime, I\u2019ll continue to listen to the community and be very open to the public process that results. The Chronicle reported: The statue is a \u2018permanent\u2019 piece of public art, so it has to go through a de-accession review process, which involves communicating with the artist and move through the Public Art Committee and Arts Commission, which can recommend the removal to the City Council. The City Council has that ultimate authority to de-accession a permanent artwork like the Fallon Statue, said Michael Ogilvie, San Jose\u2019s public art director. Camarillo told the Chronicle that to some Mexican Americans \u201cand to anyone that has a historical consciousness,\u201d the statue is seen as \u201cputting someone who is the manifestation of the worst elements of Manifest Destiny.\u201d \u201cIf it causes injury to some subset of a population in the public realm \u2014 Mexican Americans, Latinos constitute the largest minority in San Jose \u2014 if a subset of that population feels harmed, affected by that statue, which does what?\u201d Camarillo said, adding it \u201cshows that the United States was taken, that Mexican California was taken by a violent overthrow of the American Republic in 1846.

Who needs him? Not House of Cards, it turns out, as Netflix announced it is carrying on with production of the series without its now disgraced, former star. Spacey, who played President Frank Underwood on the hit show, was dropped from the series after numerous men came forward with allegations of sexual abuse and harassment including out gay actor Anthony Rapp. Rapp alleged Spacey tried to take advantage of him when he was just 14. Spacey then tried to deflect the issue by coming out as gay himself. The series has tapped Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear to take over as co-stars of the drama, likely hoping the big names can distract from the absence of its lead. Production resumed on Tuesday after a three-month hiatus, and Netflix announced the additions of Lane and Kinnear, who will play brother and sister, today. The show\u2019s co-star,\u00a0Robin Wright, who plays Claire Underwood, will also reportedly play a central role in this, the sixth and final season. It is expected to be released later this year, and will be eight episodes long, down from the usual 13, reports The New York Times. While the show\u2019s ratings have dipped in recent years, it is still considered one of Netflix\u2019s flagship shows, earning it numerous award nominations and wins. The retooling of the show will keep the company from having to pull the plug entirely, like it did with a planned original movie about Gore Vidal that was to star Spacey as the writer, and a Louis CK stand-up special.

Kylie Minogue has dropped the music video for her new single \u201cDancing.\u201d The song is the debut single from her new album \u201cGolden,\u201d which comes out on April 6. In the video, Minogue, 49, wears cowboy boots and sparkly Western-inspired outfits. She strums her guitar, also adorned with glitter, and partakes in some line dancing for the pop-country track. Minogue told Chris Evans at BBC Radio 2 that she was \u201cfragile\u201d working on the album, a possible reference to her recent breakup with\u00a0Joshua Sasse, and says she took inspiration from Nashville. \u201cIt was a really good time to be honest and work through everything, and give a snapshot of where I am in my life\u2026. A lot of it was done in Nashville, and that taught me about putting more story into the song\u2026. And then you can take that song and produce that any way you want,\u201d Minogue says.

The Middle Eastern country where Islam is the state religion will welcome soccer players, coaches and fans from all around the planet, beginning Nov. 20, for matches that will pit nation against nation. Qatar has promised to welcome LGBTQ foreigners, even as its own people are tortured and put to death for being who they are. On Monday, Qatar\u2019s ambassador to Germany got an earful from one of those men at a human rights conference in Frankfurt, hosted by the German Football Association, according to a report by the Associated Press. Fan representative Dario Minden spoke in English directly to Abdulla bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Thani, about who he is and who he loves, Minden told him to \u201cabolish the death penalty\u201d for homosexuality. \u201cI\u2019m a man and I love men. I do \u2014 please don\u2019t be shocked \u2014 have sex with other men. This is normal,\u201d Minden told Al Thani. \u201cSo, please get used to it, or stay out of football. Because the most important rule in football is, football is for everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re lesbian, if you\u2019re gay. It\u2019s for everyone. For the boys. For the girls. And for everyone in between. \u201cSo, abolish the death penalty. Abolish all of the penalties regarding sexual and gender identity,\u201d he said. A representative of Germany's association of fan and ultra groups went on stage to speak to the DFB's conference on human rights in Qatar ahead of the World Cup.Here's his personal speech on LGBT rights in the country, addressed directly at Qatar's ambassador to Germany. pic.twitter.com/ODYZrsYWyq  Although organizers promised Al Thani an opportunity to respond, the Associated Press reports that portion of the conference was closed to the public and the news media and was not televised. Earlier, Al Thani reportedly complained to those assembled that the issue of human rights was a distraction from the World Cup, even though the event was titled, \u201cSport and Human Rights.\u201d \u201cWe all care about human rights,\u201d said Al Thani. \u201cBut I would have enjoyed (it) more if I saw some concentration not only on just one subject, but the enjoyment of football and the football effect on people around the world.\u201d More than 5,000 miles away in San Francisco, a gay Qatari physician has organized a petition to tell the land of his birth: Love Is Not A Crime. Doctor Nasser Mohamed decided to come out in 2010 following a visit to the U.S., and spent his residency in Connecticut before moving to California in 2015. Mohamed wrote in an op-ed published by Outsports last month that he has spent the last decade caring for the LGBTQ community in outpatient settings and growing as an activist. \u201cBeing an LGBT person is a criminal offense in the legal system in Qatarm as is sex between two men. There are state-sponsored conversion-therapy practices, and LGBT-affirming psychotherapy is not offered.\u201d He wrote how law enforcement uses media and chat rooms to find, jail and punish people for being LGBTQ. \u201cVisibility of the local LGBT community in Qatar, and the exposure of their treatment, are absolutely essential,\u201d Mohamed wrote. \u201cI am doing my part by speaking up.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: Find out about Mohamed\u2019s petition by clicking here. He is also raising money through a GoFundMe account to provide him with funding for his activism as well as security and protection.

The latest is a clampdown on what it sees as \u00e2\u0080\u009clove jihad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the belief that Muslims are seeking to deceive Hindu women through marriage and convert them to Islam. Related:\u00c2\u00a0Putting a price on women's unpaid work in India\u00c2 Over the course of the past year or so,\u00c2\u00a0several BJP politicians have suggested that this is part of an Islamic conspiracy to increase India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Muslim population. Related:\u00c2\u00a0Coronavirus widens the\u00c2\u00a0Hindu-Muslim divide in India\u00c2 More recently, one of India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most populous states has assumed the right to intervene in matters of marriage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly between a Hindu woman and a Muslim man. Other states are planning to follow suit. As a political scientist, I see the rapid growth of religious tensions/conflicts in India as a continuation of BJP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anti-Muslim policies. Despite being a Hindu-majority country, India is home to nearly 200 million Muslims. Related:\u00c2\u00a0Citizenship\u00c2\u00a0law may do 'irreversible damage' to\u00c2\u00a0India's\u00c2\u00a0secular fabric Since the BJP came to power with a clear majority in parliament in August 2019, it stripped the special provisions in the Indian Constitution that had granted a substantial degree of autonomy to India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 now a Union Territory, an arrangement in India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s federal dispensation under the direct rule of the national government. In 2019, the Indian government also passed the Citizenship Amendment Act, which eases the pathway to citizenship for a range of religious groups from India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighboring countries but excludes Muslims. Related:\u00c2\u00a0India's citizenship\u00c2\u00a0act tied to complex history of nation-building Now, in its latest move, India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, where about a fifth of the population is Muslim and the state government is led by the BJP, has taken to policing the private lives of its citizens. In November, the state passed the first \u00e2\u0080\u009clove jihad\u00e2\u0080\u009d law in the country. Known as the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, it requires couples from different religious communities to provide two months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 notice to a district magistrate before getting married. A district magistrate officially belongs\u00c2\u00a0to India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administrative services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a vestige of the British colonial rule \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who is in charge of the district, the basic unit of administration, and has legal as well as significant executive powers. Under the terms of the ordinance, the presiding judicial official would have the discretion to decide whether the conversion was through compulsion; the offending person could then be denied bail and sentenced to 10 years in prison. The irony of this issue is that few individuals routinely choose to marry outside their religious affiliation. Notionally, this law applies with equal force to all interfaith marriages. However, for all practical purposes this would affect Muslims, as Islamic personal law requires a non-Muslim to convert to sanctify the marriage. So far, enforcement has targeted only Hindu-Muslim marriages. Since its passage last year, as many as 30 Muslim men arrested in Uttar Pradesh are facing possible prosecution. It remains unclear at this stage what sanctions Muslim women marrying Hindu men might confront. Related:\u00c2\u00a0Durga Vahini women take up arms to protect\u00c2\u00a0Hindu\u00c2\u00a0identity Following the lead of Uttar Pradesh, four other BJP-ruled states are introducing similar legislation. In late December, the central state of Madhya Pradesh passed the Freedom of Religion Bill, which would also place similar restrictions on interreligious marriage. This law also holds the possibility of 10 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 imprisonment. Since the BJP holds a majority in the state legislature, there is a strong possibility of this becoming a law. Thus far there has not been any effort to enact a national law. Currently, the BJP rules in 16 out of India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 29 states, and several other states are said to be considering enacting such a law. The strong opposition to any kind of conversion goes back to British India. In the 1920s, a Hindu revivalist movement known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cshuddhi\u00e2\u0080\u009d emerged. It sought to reconvert those who had chosen to embrace other faiths, most notably Islam. At the time, interfaith marriages were a rarity. The movement had a strongly patriarchal tenor and portrayed Hindu women as hapless victims of the ruses of Muslim men. This movement, while it initially acquired a degree of support, faded out as other more compelling social and political issues, such as anti-colonial nationalism, came to the fore. A somewhat similar fervor, I argue, has now returned in independent India. Apart from this legislative onslaught, two other recent incidents, in particular, bear particular mention. The first involved a TV\u00c2\u00a0advertisement for a high-end jewelry chain that was launched on Indian TV\u00c2\u00a0in October. The advertisement was from Tanishq, an affiliate of one of India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest conglomerates, the Tata Group, and was titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cEkatvam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnity\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Hindi. The advertisement depicted a Hindu woman and a Muslim man preparing for a wedding. As soon as the advertisements were aired, some Hindu activists protested vigorously on social media. The company, fearing violence, withdrew the advertisement altogether. The other episode took place in November when Netflix aired BBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adaptation of the novel \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Suitable Boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the acclaimed Indian writer Vikram Seth. Related:\u00c2\u00a0Netflix's 'Ghee Happy' imagines life as a\u00c2\u00a0Hindu\u00c2\u00a0deity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in preschool\u00c2 Once again, some Hindu activists protested because it depicted a Hindu-Muslim couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passionate kiss. The activists claimed that the film was \u00e2\u0080\u009cencouraging love jihad\u00e2\u0080\u009d and had \u00e2\u0080\u009churt religious sentiments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Accordingly, they demanded that it be forthrightly withdrawn. A minister in the state of Madhya Pradesh lodged a formal police complaint against the showing of the film, and further investigations are on. Urban couples in India are increasingly stepping out from the tradition of arranged marriages and choosing their own life partners, sometimes across religious lines. No previous government has sought to regulate such choices. However, under the Modi government, right-wing Hindu groups are harassing such couples. Related:\u00c2\u00a0In India, WhatsApp is a weapon of antisocial hatred\u00c2 Activists have spoken out vigorously against this tide of vigilantism, and some regional courts have questioned the very basis of a law that encroaches on individual freedoms. However, at a time when personal choices are under attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has maintained a studious silence.

Myanmar Coup Puts Halt to Democratic Transition Myanmar\u2019s military has seized control of the country and detained several leaders of the democratically elected National League for Democracy party (NLD)\u2014including the country\u2019s de facto president Aung San Suu Kyi. The coup began with mass arrests in the early hours of Monday morning, on the same day lawmakers were to take their seats in parliament for the opening session following November\u2019s election. A statement read later on military-run television, signed by Vice President Myint Swe, said control of \u201clegislation, administration and judiciary\u201d was now in the hands of General Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military, for the next 12 months. That election had been the subject of increased tension between the military\u2014who still controlled key state ministries as well as holding a quarter of seats in parliament\u2014and the NLD. Without evidence, military leaders have alleged massive voting irregularities\u201410 million cases of voter fraud\u2014and demanded voter lists be released by the country\u2019s election commission for analysis. A complicated landslide. November\u2019s vote saw the NLD win a landslide victory, increasing their overall majority in parliament. Although international observers did not point to widespread fraud, the election was criticized for disenfranchising Myanmar\u2019s ethnic minorities: Virtually all Rohingya are barred from voting and voting was canceled in Rakhine state, home to both Rohingya and the Buddhist Rakhine minority. Fears of a coup were driven to high point in recent days after Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, in a speech published in the military-run Myawaddy newspaper, warned it may be\u00a0\u201cnecessary to revoke the constitution\u201d in certain circumstances. Pressure on Biden. Those circumstances arriving not only put the future of Myanmar\u2019s democracy movement in question, but add another pressing issue for a Biden administration eager to reorient U.S. policy toward Asia. In a foreshadowing of possible sanctions, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement that the United States \u201cwill take action against those responsible,\u201d if the military\u2019s moves are not soon reversed. The World This Week On Tuesday, Feb. 2, French President Emmanuel Macron addresses a U.S. audience on transatlantic relations as he takes part in a virtual discussion hosted by the Atlantic Council. On Wednesday, Feb. 3, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to vote on the nomination of Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations following her confirmation hearing last week. U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to deliver a speech outlining his plans for U.S. foreign policy over the course of his presidency. On Thursday, Feb. 4, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borell begins a three day trip to Russia, beginning with a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. On Saturday, Feb. 6, African Union heads of state and government meet for a leaders summit in Addis Ababa. On Sunday, Feb. 7, Ecuador holds presidential and legislative elections. Andr\u00e9s Arauz, the 35-year-old left-wing proteg\u00e9 of former President Rafael Correa, and Guillermo Lasso, a conservative banker, lead the polls heading into the presidential vote. What We\u2019re Following Today Navalny protests erupt again. Protests in support of jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny continued on Sunday, as more than 5,000 protesters were arrested across the country. Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny\u2019s wife, was one of those detained by police, although she was later released. The Sunday protests, if they begin to follow the same pattern as Belarus, could end up a carefully managed sideshow for Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Alexander Gabuev writes in Foreign Policy, a few street protests will not be enough to dislodge the Russian leader.\u00a0\u201cIt is very hard to see how weekly protests \u2026 will somehow force a regime willing to poison a prominent opposition leader with a deadly nerve agent to simply let Navalny go free,\u201d he writes. EU U-turn. European Union officials have admitted to making a \u201cblunder\u201d after the European Commission invoked emergency powers on Friday to impose trade restrictions across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland\u2014effectively undermining their longstanding opposition to a hard border on the island during years of Brexit negotiations and uniting British and Irish leaders in anger. The decision, soon reversed, was made as part of the EU\u2019s imposition of export controls, still in place, on coronavirus vaccines made in the bloc. The World Health Organization\u2019s vice-head Mariangela Simao has criticized the move as part of \u201ca very worrying trend.\u201d Modi speaks on farmer protests. Ahead of today\u2019s budget announcement, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the actions of some protesters during last week\u2019s farmer protests in New Delhi an \u201cinsult\u201d to India\u2019s flag\u2014his first public comments after months of farmer unrest. His comments came after protesters raised the Sikh religious flag as well as a farmer\u2019s union flag alongside India\u2019s tricolor after they had stormed the historic Red Fort on India\u2019s national holiday. Modi, speaking in his monthly radio address, added that his government is \u201ccommitted to modernizing agriculture and is also taking many steps in that direction.\u201d Keep an Eye On Taiwan tensions. Taiwan\u2019s defense ministry announced that six Chinese fighter aircraft had entered its air identification zone on Sunday, along with one U.S. reconnaissance aircraft\u2014a rare admission of U.S. activity around the island. Taiwanese officials said that both countries\u2019 aircraft had flown inside the south-western corner of its declared zone. \u00a0The increased aerial traffic comes as Chinese forces are reported to have simulated missiles strikes on a nearby U.S. aircraft carrier as part of a military exercise days after Biden\u2019s inauguration. Central African Republic\u2019s refugee exodus. Over 200,000 people have fled the Central African Republic since violence erupted following a disputed presidential election on Dec. 27, the United Nations refugee agency has reported. The International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, a 12-member regional group, has called for a cease-fire, as well as the lifting of a 2013 U.N. arms embargo in order to provide weapons to government troops. Writing in Foreign Policy on Jan. 29, former U.S. Ambassador to CAR Laurence Wohlers explained why the prospects for wider international intervention are limited. Odds and Ends Scandinavia\u2019s largest film festival is reflecting upon the coronavirus pandemic and themes of social isolation by giving one movie buff the chance to watch the festival\u2019s offerings alone for a week on a desolate island. Lisa Enroth, an emergency nurse, was selected among thousands of volunteers to experience \u201cThe Isolated Cinema\u201d that organizers have set up at the top of a lighthouse on the island of Hamneskar in western Sweden. The unusual treatment is part of artistic director Jonas Holmberg\u2019s vision for the festival, where he hopes to highlight how the pandemic has changed a viewer\u2019s relationship with film. Movies will still be shown at the festival\u2019s traditional home\u2014the 700-seat Draken cinema in Goteborg\u2014although only one ticket, drawn by lottery, is available for each screening.

A proper understanding is a prerequisite for properly forming people in the truth and properly ministering to people in need. As new gender ideologies are promoted throughout America, their lies will impact not only those who suffer from gender dysphoria, but all children who need to mature in their self-understanding as a boy or girl, man or woman, a potential husband or wife, father or mother. In 2007, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital \u201cbecame the first major program in the United States to focus on transgender children and adolescents,\u201d as its website brags. A decade later, more than 45 pediatric gender clinics have opened their doors to our nation\u2019s children. Parents are told that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones may be the only way to prevent their children from committing suicide. Never mind that the best studies of gender dysphoria show that between 80 and 95 percent of children who express a discordant gender identity will come to identify with their bodily sex if natural development is allowed to proceed. Never mind that \u201ctransitioning\u201d treatment has not been shown to reduce the extraordinarily high rate of suicide attempts among people who identify as transgender (41 percent, compared with 4.6 percent of the general population). Never mind that people who have had transition surgery are 19 times more likely to die by suicide. These statistics should be enough to halt the headlong rush into \u201ctransitioning\u201d and prompt us to find more effective ways to prevent these tragic outcomes. Most of all, we shouldn\u2019t be encouraging children to \u201ctransition,\u201d or making heroes and role models of those who have done so. We should be tolerant\u2014indeed, loving\u2014toward those who struggle with their gender identity, but also be aware of the harm done to the common good, particularly to children, when transgender identity is normalized. Transgender activists are not merely asking for tolerance or kindness. They are demanding affirmation, not just from adults but from children and adolescents who are already challenged by the normal process of sexual development. In a culture where transgender identities are not only affirmed but celebrated, everyone will be compelled to construct their own gender identity, unaided by a common understanding of sex differences and why they matter.  In my new book \u201cWhen Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,\u201d I show that the best biology, psychology, and philosophy all support an understanding of sex as a bodily reality, and an understanding of gender as a social manifestation of bodily sex. Biology isn\u2019t bigotry. A sound understanding of gender rejects sex stereotypes on the one hand and androgyny on the other. The virtuous mean is a view of gender that reveals meaningful sex differences and communicates the difference they make\u2014a view that takes sex differences seriously while upholding the fundamental equality of the sexes as complements to one another. The most helpful therapies do not try to remake the body to conform with thoughts and feelings\u2014which is impossible\u2014but rather to help people find healthy ways to manage their tension and move toward accepting the reality of their bodily selves. My book provides a nuanced view of our sexed embodiment, a balanced approach to policy issues involving transgender identity and gender more broadly, and a sober and honest survey of the human costs of getting human nature wrong.

The chart-topping singer arrived in the capital Dakar where she on Friday will join the Global Partnership for Education talks co-hosted by Senegalese President Macky Sall and French leader Emmanuel Macron. Rihanna, the fourth most followed person on Twitter with 86 million followers, took to social media to urge Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to ensure specific funding levels. In her tweet to Macron, Rihanna -- who met with him in Paris in July -- thanked the French leader for leading the conference but pressed him to commit firmly to 250 million euros ($313 million) for the effort. Speaking to Turnbull, she urged funding as part of Australia's entry onto the UN Human Rights Council. Some 264 million school-age children and youths are living without any education owing to poverty, conflict and social barriers including bias against girls, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. The Dakar conference, which brings together governments and the private sector, aims to raise $3.1 billion over the coming three years to support education for 870 million children. The conference in turn asks partner countries to devote 20 percent of public expenditure to education -- a level that can be particularly difficult for countries battling jihadists or civil conflicts. Rihanna, who serves as an ambassador for the Global Partnership for Education, will meet in Dakar with government officials as well as educators and students, representatives said. She has frequently been active in pressing for development funding as part of Global Citizen, the anti-poverty campaign that includes policy events and concerts in New York and a growing number of other cities. The Barbados-born singer -- whose hits include \"Diamonds\" and \"Only Girl (In the World\") -- has also set up the non-profit Clara Lionel Foundation, which includes a scholarship fund for students to learn at US universities. With her Twitter account, she has repeatedly approached leaders including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to raise development issues.

Vicari warns. The statement was made in the context of recent discussion about the status of the all-Republican freeholder board\u2019s federal lawsuit against the \u201cImmigrant Trust Directive,\u201d established by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal. The executive order, which went into effect in March 2019,\u00a0restricts routine cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Elected officials in Ocean County, perhaps the most politically conservative in the state, vehemently oppose the state-imposed directive\u00a0and the county government has\u00a0filed a federal lawsuit against Grewal in an effort to stop it. \u201cYou know, this goes back to not only the Constitution, but also to the Civil War when we said, \u2018who\u2019s going to run the country? Is it going to be state\u2019s rights or a strong national government?\u2019\u201d Vicari asked in public remarks he made during\u00a0an agenda session of the board on Wednesday. \u201cAnd it was decided at that time that we would have a strong national government. &mldr We have 50 states, so each one is going to make different laws. And then what\u2019s going to happen? It\u2019s going to destroy the union and that\u2019s why we had a Civil War. &mldr Our stand is clear and as it should be: There\u2019re no areas of gray.\u201d In December, the state filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Trenton to dismiss\u00a0Ocean County\u2019s complaint, as well as a similar lawsuit\u00a0brought by Cape May County. The\u00a0federal court has\u00a0combined the matters in\u00a0a single docket. On Jan. 21, both counties filed briefs in opposition to\u00a0the state's motion to dismiss. The next day,\u00a0the U.S. Department of Justice filed a \u201cstatement of interest\u201d in support of the counties. The National Sheriffs\u2019 Association also has filed an amicus brief that\u00a0backs\u00a0the legal arguments of the counties, said Freeholder Jack Kelly, director of law and public safety for Ocean County. On the other side of the legal argument, the American Civil Liberties Union has filed an amicus brief in support of the state of New Jersey, Kelly noted. [ The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. ] Vicari said the county government\u00a0was grateful for the federal government\u2019s support. \u201cWe pander to no one except the U.S. Constitution and to the people of Ocean County, because we do the right thing,\u201d Vicari said. In a prepared statement released on Jan. 25, Grewal said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed that the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Justice\u00a0and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u201d had filed the legal challenge,\u00a0more than one year after he issued the directive. \u201cAt a time when we need to be building bridges with our immigrant communities, the federal government is working to push them further into the shadows,\u201d Grewal said. Freeholder Gerry P. Little pointed out at the board meeting Wednesday that the oath of office freeholders take upon the start of their terms is foremost an oath to support the U.S.\u00a0Constitution. \u201cSo, what the state government has attempted to do is ask us to violate our oath of office, not to obey the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Little said. Little said the directive\u00a0has put\u00a0state, county and local law enforcement officers in\u00a0\u201ca quandary;\u201d forced to decide whether to uphold their oaths to the U.S. Constitution or adhere to an executive fiat from the New Jersey attorney general. \u201cThey\u2019ve done the same thing with many other laws, such as (pertaining to) certain chemical substances and a lot of other issues,\u201d Little said.

So, we\u2019ll have to see where it goes. I believe we should be, and we will be successful in our case.\u201d The Immigrant Trust Directive \u2014 which carries the weight of law \u2014 prohibits\u00a0local, county and state law enforcement officers from stopping, searching or detaining immigrants at the request of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. There are exceptions for cases of serious or violent crimes, or in the event a final deportation order is issued by a U.S. immigration court. The directive is intended to build\u00a0trust and improve cooperation between communities of immigrants and police in New Jersey, but it\u2019s also meant to be\u00a0a public rebuke of President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial policies and rhetoric on illegal immigration.

While you\u2019re at it, download our app, too. ] In Toms River, the directive has forced\u00a0Ocean County Jail officials to reduce their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, rather than face potential prosecution by Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s\u00a0administration. The policy has incensed Kelly and other Ocean freeholders, who operate and fund the jail with county taxpayer money. The freeholder board\u00a0presides over a county where Trump won almost 65 percent of the vote in 2016, or 179,079 votes out of\u00a0the 276,725\u00a0cast. The county delivered more votes for Trump than any other in New Jersey, even though Hillary Clinton ultimately won the state\u2019s 14 electoral votes. \u201cIf this goes (against us) and each state has a right to pick and choose (which laws to obey) &mldr then what\u2019s next?\u201d Vicari asked. \u201cThe Bill of Rights? You have 10 amendments to the Bill of Rights in the United States. What\u2019s next? The First Amendment? The Second Amendment?\u201d \u201cWell, tell me that\u2019s not under attack,\u201d Kelly replied. \u201cEverything\u2019s under attack,\u201d Vicari said. Freeholder Virginia E. Haines said the First and Second Amendments \u201care always under attack.\u201d Kelly agreed. \u201cThe Constitution is constantly under attack and we\u2019ve got to constantly be vigilant in defending the Constitution of the United States and we will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole board took a courageous step last year as the first county in the state of New Jersey to file (a legal challenge against the directive) and then we were joined by Cape May County.\u201d Ocean County General Counsel John C. Sahradnik said the crux of their legal argument\u00a0is that immigration law is the exclusive domain of the federal government and, therefore, state government\u00a0has\u00a0no authority to interfere in the enforcement of such law. New Jersey\u2019s motion to dimiss the case is based on an\u00a0argument\u00a0that Ocean and Cape May counties\u00a0are mere political subdivisions of New Jersey, not autonomous\u00a0administrative regions\u00a0independent of\u00a0state government. Therefore, its 21 counties have no legal standing to sue the state government that established them.\u00a0Moreover, the motion asserts that the attorney general\u2019s directive is not in violation of federal law and is constitutional within the framework\u00a0of New Jersey\u2019s\u00a0sovereignty as a state. Lastly, the state has invoked the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 11th\u00a0Amendment \u2014 which protects New Jersey from being sued in federal court, according to a summary of the arguments provided to the freeholder board last week. \u201cThe federal government\u2019s efforts to coerce states into implementing its immigration agenda have failed repeatedly in the past, and we\u2019ll respond to their latest efforts in court at the appropriate time,\u201d Grewal said. We're deeply disappointed by DOJ\u2019s decision to challenge NJ's Immigrant Trust Directive. Here in the Garden State, we're working hard to strengthen trust between immigrants & local police, & it's unfortunate DOJ is trying to undermine our efforts to strengthen public safety. pic.twitter.com/y9CHBqCozF In its opposition to the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the case, Ocean County\u00a0argues \u2014 that even as a political subdivision\u00a0of\u00a0New Jersey\u00a0\u2014 it has\u00a0the lawful right to protect itself from a state government acting in defiance of federal law.

By twisting the historic meaning of the word \"sex\" in the Title IX education amendment of 1972 to include something other than biological \"male or female,\" Biden has created a monster! Under this socially-radical and disturbing Democrat decree, any educational institution that receives federal funding must now admit biologically-male athletes to women's teams, compete for women's scholarships, share locker rooms and other biologically-separated spaces, including forcing female members of our military to shower with biological men. Alliance Defending Freedom legal counsel Christiana Holcomb wrote that this reckless action will \"gut legal protections for women by denying female athletes fair competition in sports, ignoring women's unique health needs, and forcing vulnerable girls to share intimate spaces with men who identify as female.\" Parsing the consequences as simply as possible author Ryan Anderson explained: \"Boys who identify as girls must be allowed to compete in the girls' athletic competitions, men who identify as women must be allowed in women-only spaces, health care plans must pay for gender transition procedures and doctors and hospitals must perform them.\" Emilie Kao, an attorney with the Heritage Foundation, says America's new 46th president\u2014despite all his talk about \"unity\"\u2014has shown he is \"committed to advancing a radically divisive transgender agenda and has set women back decades.\" There is nothing \"equal\" in pitting biological boys against biological girls. The lunacy of this extreme, \"progressive\" political policy denies acknowledged reality from all of human history and \"established science\" that only two sexes\u2014male and female\u2014exist in the human race\" (Matt. 19:3; Gen. 1:27, 5:2)\u2014one or the other, not both. Chromosomes don't lie, nor are they confused. These gendered individuals may express their biological masculinity or femininity in varied and diverse ways, according to their unique physical and emotional makeup. They are each unique individuals of equal worth, purpose and value to our Creator God. Misguided Gendering The Bible clearly states, \"But from the beginning of the creation God 'made them male and female'\" (Mark 10:6). Christian author and Bible teacher Larry Tomczak correctly clarified, \"People can protest all they want, yet the Scriptures and scientific fact prove that men and women are different and men possess larger bones, lungs, bone density, muscle fiber and something called testosterone. This explains why the fastest female sprinter in the world, Allyson Felix, has a lifetime best in the 440-meter that was handily beaten by 300 high school boys in recent statistics.\" Sensuous and confusing times like these were described by the apostle Paul in key verses of Romans 1: Refusing to know God, they soon didn't know how to be human either\u2014women didn't know how to be women, men didn't know how to be men. Sexually confused, they abused and defiled one another, women with women, men with men\u2014all lust, no love. And then they paid for it, oh, how they paid for it\u2014emptied of God and love, godless and loveless wretches (Rom. 1:26-17, MSG). Unfortunately, many are reluctant to confront these radical, gender-ideologies and social changes directly for fear of being called hateful and hurtful names. They don't want to truthfully and objectively say that LGBTQ ideology and high-risk, sexual practices are harmful and destructive beliefs and behavior, based on junk science and sensual lust. In the name of \"equality,\" this executive order claims (without any scientific evidence) that there is no difference physically between biological boys and girls. It marginalizes women, confuses children and feminizes boys. In an op-ed in The Washington Post last year, three current or former female athletes\u2014Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova and Sanya Richards-Ross\u2014asserted: \"The evidence is unequivocal that, starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science.\" There is nothing \"equal\" or \"fair\" in pitting biological boys against biological girls. Chromosomes don't lie nor are they confused. This binary pair of individuals may express their biological masculinity and femininity in varied and diverse ways, according to their unique physical and emotional makeup. These gendered expressions are neither identical nor interchangeable but essential to God's creational plan. These physical differences are to be embraced as divine design. This is why males and females are (uniquely) equipped sexually to physically reproduce (Gen. 1:28, 2:20). They are biologically and emotionally equipped to fulfill a mutually-complementary and covenantal relationship before their Creator God (Eph. 5:21-33). This is why the apostle Paul challenges homosexual partnerships as deviating from the natural relations or natural function of male-female sexual intercourse (Rom. 1:26-27), as designed and ordained by our Creator God. The Bible clearly teaches that men should not act sexually as women (Lev. 18:22, Rom. 1:18-32, 1 Cor. 6:9-10) or dress like women (Deut. 22:5), and when men or women approve of or engage in other-gendered expressions of identity, it is a disgrace (1 Cor. 11:14-15). We do not have an inalienable right to do whatever we want with our physical selves. We are all made in the image of God and are to glorify Him in our bodies and in our spirits, which belong to Him, as our Creator (1 Cor. 6:12-20). The apostle Paul taught that God's wrath is revealed against those \"who suppress the truth through unrighteousness\" (Rom. 1:18). Tampering with God's created order will not go well\u2014whether for common sinners nor politicized legislators and presidents.

So when the White House pushed back against what it describes as attacks against two of their recently appointed staffers, it acted as if it was striking a blow for decency against bias, meanness and partisanship. The fact that the two who were under fire came from two very different backgrounds\u2014one a Jewish American and the other a Palestinian American\u2014made the support they received from President Joe Biden all the more important. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne sounded a note that seemingly all Americans could get behind when she said the following: \u201cWe are appalled by recent spurious accusations against our staff. We welcome oversight and scrutiny, but there is no justification for false and ad hominem attacks based on ethnic, racial or religious identity.\u201d The seemingly perfect symmetry of both a Jew and a Palestinian being abused in the same way sets up the administration for the kind of virtue signaling that they assumed would generate universal applause. But not so fast. In lumping attacks directed at Deputy National Security Adviser for Cybersecurity Anne Neuberger in with criticism of Maher Bitar, the National Security Agency\u2019s senior director for intelligence, the White House was performing a not-so-subtle sleight of hand trick. The goal was to allow outrage at the clearly illegitimate attacks on Neuberger for having dual loyalty because of her family foundation\u2019s support for AIPAC to serve as cover and to distract from the entirely justified questions raised about Bitar\u2019s past as a BDS activist. Neuberger is an Orthodox woman from Brooklyn, N.Y., and the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors. Her parents were among those passengers rescued by Israeli commandos in the 1976 Entebbe raid. Having grown up in what has been described as one of America\u2019s 100 wealthiest families, she has a background in finance but has spent the last 12 years at the NSA in non-political jobs working under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, and now Biden, who has tapped her to head the unit working to counter cyber threats. No Orthodox woman has risen higher in national security affairs. As the first Palestinian American to hold such a powerful position, Bitar is also a groundbreaker. He was the first Palestinian American ever to serve in the White House when Obama chose him to be director of Israel and Palestinian Affairs at the National Security Council. He has also served in a variety of posts, including as a deputy to America\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power. During the last administration, he served as general counsel for the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, where he worked closely with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to promote accusations that Trump was guilty of collusion with Russia, which were ultimately proved false, and then on the effort to impeach him. As a reward for his service to his party, he is now in a position of unique power as the man who decides what intelligence is fed to the White House, as well as priorities for security operations. So while both Neuberger and Bitar can be considered role models for demographic groups that were not to be seen in the corridors of power in the past, there\u2019s a world of difference between the criticisms they were subjected to in the last week. Neuberger was the target of a spurious hit job by the left-wing magazine Mother Jones that was picked up by NBC News (though the latter ultimately retracted it for not meeting their standards of journalism). In it, David Corn, a longtime bitter critic of Israel and its supporters, questions Neuberger\u2019s fitness for a national security position because her family foundation has supported pro-Israel causes and AIPAC, the umbrella pro-Israel lobby. The clear implication of the piece was that no one who is connected to pro-Israel organizations should be trusted with America\u2019s secrets because they are likely to be guilty of dual loyalty, a traditional anti-Semitic trope. In it, Corn dug up the outrageous charges of espionage against two AIPAC employees that were dropped as groundless and, of course, also raised the Jonathan Pollard affair in an attempt to show that Israel is a threat to the United States. Corn, who has always brandished his own Jewish background as a defense against criticism of his anti-Israel bias, defended himself on Twitter by citing a passage from Obama\u2019s recent book venting his own grudges against AIPAC because it opposed some of his dangerous policies. The point of the article was not so much to take a deep dive into the list of the charities that Neuberger\u2019s family supports, which is both impressive and praiseworthy, but to make it clear that loyal Americans who deserve to be trusted with secrets should have nothing to do with pro-Israel causes. By stigmatizing American Jews who support the alliance with the Jewish state, Mother Jones was making it clear that only Jews who divest themselves of a basic element of Jewish identity and faith\u2014love of Israel\u2014deserve office. That\u2019s an anti-Semitic smear that can be categorized with other recent attacks on Jews such as those of Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who have also raised the dual-loyalty charge, claiming that Jews are buying Congress and manipulating U.S. foreign policy. The questions raised about Bitar focus on the fact that while he was a student at Georgetown University, he was a board member of Students for Justice in Palestine\u2014a group that is notorious for spreading anti-Semitic libels against Israel and Jews, as well as for promoting divestment and boycotts of the Jewish state. At Georgetown, he organized a conference of the Palestine Solidarity Movement at which he ran a session on how to demonize Israel and appeared alongside speakers who praised terrorism against Jewish targets. But rather than a youthful folly, other items on his resume show that he took his BDS beliefs with him on his path towards success in government. He interned at the anti-Israel Foundation for Middle East Peace and then worked at the U.N. Relief Works Agency, which has perpetuated the Palestinian refugee problem in order to serve as a weapon to use against Israel. At no point in his glittering career is there a record of him disavowing BDS and its goal of destroying Israel or the anti-Semitic smears it propagates. Are the charges against Bitar the moral equivalent those against Neuberger? That\u2019s only true if you think defending the existence of the one Jewish state on the planet is morally equivalent to an anti-Semitic war to destroy it. There can be no religious test for office or one based on one\u2019s ethnic origin. Palestinian Americans and Jews should be judged on their individual merits, not on their faith or background. But we do have a right to ask why a record of supporting a hate group like SJP is treated as a non-issue by the administration. And we should be outraged that it thinks support for a pro-Israel cause is just as legitimate as backing one that wishes to wipe out the Jewish state. We have no doubt that Neuberger will serve Biden and the nation just as well as she served Obama and Trump in her efforts to defend the country against cyber threats. But we have every reason to wonder why an administration that assures us that it supports the alliance with Israel is putting one of the most important national security jobs in the hands of someone like Matar, who, in the absence of any disavowal of his past connections and positions, may still wish to see that ally disappear.
